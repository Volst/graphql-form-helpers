# GraphQL Form Helpers

An opinionated package for dealing with complicated forms that have nested data and use GraphQL.

We use it in combination with [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) and [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), but it is not specific to either one.

**Features:**

* Convert data from a GraphQL query to suitable form data (strips `__typename` recursively, loads defaults if empty).
* Convert form data to a GraphQL mutation.
